# Tagged Front-End Coding Challenge

At Tagged we love foosball. Arguments over who is the best are settled on the table, but nobody can remember the scores from weeks ago. We need a way to track the results and for everyone to see who is the current king.

## Exercise

Create a simple application that tracks foosball ratings. You should be able to:

* Display the current rankings of all the players
* Add a new game on-the-fly
* Update existing results

## Notes

* No need to worry about persistence; refreshing the page can simply reset everything.
* There are no restrictions on which language, libraries, browser, or approach you should use. We want you to do your best with the environment you are most comfortable with so we can see you at your best.
* You should expect to spend at least an hour on this.
* If you have any questions, send us an email
* Have fun!
